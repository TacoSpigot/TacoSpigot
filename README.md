TacoSpigot
===========
[UNSUPPORTED](https://github.com/TacoSpigot/TacoSpigot#readme)

For compatibility reasons, I have published some fixes to get the API (but not the server) compiling. It is incomplete and unsupported.

I have published one final release of `tacospigot-api`. It is available on my (new) [maven repo](https://techcable.net/releases/maven/).

To be clear, this is just the API (not the server). I will not give the server jar even if you paid me.
